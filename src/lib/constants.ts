    // enforces and no bid submission or Sub estimate walk.
    question: "What counts as a seat?",
    answer:
      "A staff seat is an owner, admin, PM, or estimator, and each has a team role. A Sub seat is for a subcontractor and is not a team role: a Sub sees only the jobs and tasks you assign to them, can add updates and photos to that work, and never sees your pricing, your estimates or your team's conversations. Your first 3 seats can be either kind and are included in the base price. Staff use the included seats first, then Subs use any remaining, and your admin can switch an included seat between staff and Sub at any time. Beyond those 3, each additional staff seat is $39/month or $374/year, and each additional Sub seat is $9.99/month or $95.90/year. A Sub seat added beyond the included 3 keeps Sub access and can't be changed to a staff seat.",

// - CAPTURE: recording stops at 4 hours on iOS and Android (it said 90
//   minutes). Nothing parses "Photo: ..." out of speech; photos are saved to
//   the walk with their time, so the voice-tag sentence and bullet are gone.
// - AI ENGINE: the prompts DO make assumptions and record them, so "doesn't
//   guess" and "never assumed" were false. What is true is that assumptions
//   and low-confidence lines are flagged for the user to check.
// - EXPORT: the Buildertrend output is a CSV in the layout of Buildertrend's
//   estimate importer, uploaded by hand. There is no one-tap copy, no photo
//   packet (no PDF includes job photos), no reorder, and no PM email template;
//   the real handoff email is the automatic "assigned you" email.
